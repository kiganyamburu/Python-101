# Python-101

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises and small projects, organized by day. Each `DayX` folder corresponds to a day of learning and contains the exercises for that day.

## Project Structure

- `cyptomachine.py`: A script for encryption and decryption.
- `marble-trading.py`: A script for a marble trading game.
- `math-tutor.py`: A script for a math tutor program.
- `palindomes1.py` and `palindome2.py`: Scripts for checking palindromes.

## How to Use

You can browse the folders to see the exercises for each day. Each Python script can be run independently.
